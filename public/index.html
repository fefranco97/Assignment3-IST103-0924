        Volleyball is a dynamic team sport where two teams of six players compete to score points by hitting a ball over
        a net into the opponent's court. It requires agility, teamwork, and strategy, with key actions like serving,
        setting, spiking, and blocking. Played indoors or on sand, it's enjoyed worldwide for both recreational and
        competitive purposes.

            Volleyball demands strategic thinking, quick decision-making, and mental focus. As you anticipate your
            opponent’s moves and plan your next play, your cognitive abilities get a workout. It’s like a mental chess
            match with a net!
            <br />
            Also volleyball engages multiple muscle groups, from your upper body (hello, killer serves!) to your legs
            (those lightning-fast dives). It’s a dynamic workout that keeps you fit and agile.

            Volleyball is inherently a social sport, making it a great way to build and strengthen relationships both on
            and off the court. Whether you're playing in a local league, joining a beach volleyball game, or practicing
            with friends at the park, the sport fosters teamwork, communication, and camaraderie. The constant need for
            coordination—like setting up a perfect spike or diving for a save—encourages collaboration.

            For those who thrive on competition, volleyball offers countless opportunities to test your skills at the
            highest levels. From local leagues to international tournaments, including the Olympics, the sport
            challenges athletes to push their limits. Olympic volleyball showcases the pinnacle of competitiveness, with
            iconic moments like Brazil’s gold medal win in 2016 or the fierce rivalry between the U.S. and Russia in
            men's volleyball. Competing in such arenas not only satisfies the competitive spirit but also fosters
            growth, teamwork, and excellence on a global stage.

          <p class="personalText">
            When I was in college, I was at the beginning of a depression due to several personal issues. One day, I saw
            a poster inviting students to try out for the college volleyball team. I invited two classmates to join me,
            but in the end, I went alone. I passed the tryouts and made it onto the C team, which was the third reserve
            team.
          </p>
          <p class="personalText">
            I started attending practice every day, and through that, I made true friendships and formed strong bonds
            with my teammates. This helped me immensely in overcoming the depression I was slipping into. It gave me a
            greater purpose, which was to improve enough to make it onto the main team.
          </p>
          <p class="personalText">
            After three long years of hours and hours of training, I achieved my goal: I made it to the main team as a
            backup setter. Although I wasn’t a starter yet, I was traveling with the team to tournaments, and it felt
            like only a matter of time before I became a regular starter.
          </p>

          <p class="personalText">
            Then, during a quarterfinal game, I was subbed in, and we managed to close a 15-9 gap, bringing the score to
            17-15. In the end, we didn’t win the match, but I proved my value to the coach.
          </p>
          <p class="personalText">
            In my six years of playing volleyball, I gained new friendships, focus, physical conditioning, mental
            health, and a lot of discipline—along with medals from championships and tournaments.
            <br />
            In the photo next to this text, you can see my team and me(number 6), before heading to a tournament final.

      <h1>Basic rules</h1>
      <div class="rulesContent">
        <article>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Team Composition:</strong> Each team has six players on the court (three in the front row and
              three in the back row).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Objective</strong>: The goal is to score points by sending the ball over the net and landing it in
              the opponent's court.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Scoring</strong>: A match is typically played best out of five sets. To win a set, a team must
              score 25 points (with a two-point advantage). The fifth set, if needed, is played to 15 points.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Serving</strong>: A player serves the ball from behind the end line and must get it over the net
              into the opponent’s court. The server continues until their team loses a rally.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rotation</strong>: Teams rotate clockwise after winning a point on the opponent’s serve.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rallies</strong>: Teams are allowed up to three touches (pass, set, attack) to return the ball to
              the opponent. A player cannot hit the ball twice consecutively.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Net Violations</strong>: Players cannot touch the net or cross the center line under the net
              during play.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ball In/Out</strong>: The ball must land within the boundaries of the court. If it lands outside,
              the opposing team earns the point.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Blocking and Attacking</strong>: Front-row players can block or spike the ball near the net.
              Back-row players may attack only from behind the 10-foot line (3-meter line).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Substitutions</strong>: Teams can make a limited number of substitutions during a set, typically
              up to six.
            </li>
